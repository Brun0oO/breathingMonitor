# breathingMonitor

This project is largely inspired by this jupyter notebook written by Shui Hung Kwok :
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shkw0k/cookbook/blob/master/Breathing%20Monitor.ipynb

The purpose is to monitor breathing using a webcam and python.
My goal is to use opencv and to replace the jupyter notebook approach by a standalone python script.
